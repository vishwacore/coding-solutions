## Problem

__[collections.Counter()](https://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html#collections.Counter)__  
 A counter is a container that stores elements as dictionary keys, and their counts are stored as dictionary values.
 
 <sub> __Sample Code__ </sub>
 
    >>> from collections import Counter
    >>> 
    >>> myList = [1,1,2,3,4,5,3,2,3,4,2,1,2,3]
    >>> print Counter(myList)
    Counter({2: 4, 3: 4, 1: 3, 4: 2, 5: 1})
    >>>
    >>> print Counter(myList).items()
    [(1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 2), (5, 1)]
    >>> 
    >>> print Counter(myList).keys()
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    >>> 
    >>> print Counter(myList).values()
    [3, 4, 4, 2, 1]

Your task is to compute how much money $Raghu$ earned.

**Input Format**

The first line contains $X$, the number of shoes.  
The second line contains the space separated list of all the shoe sizes in the shop.<br>
The third line contains $N$, the number of customers.  
The next $N$ lines contain the space separated values of the $shoe \ size$ desired by the customer and $x_i$, the price of the shoe.

__Constraints__

$0 < X < 10^3$  
$0 < N \le 10^3$  
$20 < x_i < 100$  
$ 2 < shoe \ size < 20 $

```py
# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
from collections import Counter
n = int(input())
sizes = Counter(map(int, input().split()))

customers = int(input())
total = 0

for i in range(customers):
    size, price = map(int, input().split())

    if sizes[size] > 0:
        total += price
        sizes[size] -= 1

print(total)

```
